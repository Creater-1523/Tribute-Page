      Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam. 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served
      as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied
      physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly
      at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was
      intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to
      be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
      technology.He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear
      tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
      Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata
      Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",he returned
      to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several
      prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.
      While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an
      apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the
      funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.

    <p style="color: white; font-size: larger;font-style: initial;">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15
      October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras
      Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a
      local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth
      between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in
      his family.His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large
      tracts of land. Even though his ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders, the family had lost most of its
      fortunes by the 1920s and was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic found in
      coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descendance from arab traders and local women. Their business had
      involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying
      pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers in order to add to the family’s
      meager income. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and
      the family fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from the ancestral home.
      In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a
      strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.After completing his education at
      the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College,
      Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954.He
      moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.While Kalam was working
      on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his
      scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the
      Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline".He
      narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight
      positions were available in the IAF.

      After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development
      Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of
      India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his
      career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.Kalam was also
      part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.In 1969, Kalam was
      transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first
      Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July
      1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.In 1969, Kalam
      received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.

      Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.Between the 1970s and
      1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of
      which proved to be successful.</p>

    <p style="color: white; font-size: larger; font-style: initial;">Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the
      country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in
      its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought
      to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme.Despite the disapproval of the
      Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her
      discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship.Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to
      conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects.His research and educational leadership brought him
      great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme
      under his directorship.Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister,
      worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development
      of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another.R Venkatraman was instrumental in
      getting the cabinet approval for allocating ₹ 3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile
      Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive.Kalam played a major part in developing
      many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical
      surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time
      overruns.
